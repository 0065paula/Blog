The design industry has begun a set of fundamental shifts—from screens to objects, from UX as specialty to UX as basic skill, from mediated interaction to direct physicality, from agency hired guns to in-house smarties, from software to software+hardware, from apps to services. Yep, we’re entering yet another fresh period of invention—not only for our craft but for the way we think about the world and what we might build for it. When everything is an interface and everyone is a designer, things become interesting… unpredictable… full of possibility.
